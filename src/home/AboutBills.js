        <h2>The Legend of Bootleg Bill</h2>
        <div className='billsP'>
          <p>Hi! I'm Chris Ailey - Founder, Product Graphics Designer and contributing Web Developer for <span className='bigBill'>Bootleg Bill's Unofficial Audio Rarities.</span> Disregard the spiel on the homepage -- that's mostly just fluff to make us sound like a genuine commercial endeavour. The true story is this: 
          <br/><br/>
          In June of 2016, a fresh replay of the game 'Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker' inspired me to start what I had intended to be a small, one-off art piece. The goal was to design and record a copy of one of the game's world-building supplements, presented as cassette recordings of characters as they discuss contemporary events and personal histories. After replicating the tape from in-game materials and recording the audio tracks, I posted images of my prototype on a music forum and caught the attention of a 'Metal Gear' super-fan. He mentioned that he enthusiastically collected merchandise relating to it, regardless of legitimacy, and after no small amount of discussion I had been commissioned for a full set: six tapes, covering seven characters' worth of audio. The order was completed in good time and promptly changed hands, but not without leaving a taste for the craft that would drive the creation of many more pieces.
          <br/><br/>
          In 2022, Bootleg Bill's came to life as a final project submission for General Assembly's immersive software engineering bootcamp. Coordinated by the indomitable Dr. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/ailish-mclaughlin/'>Ailish McLaughlin</a> and collaborating with the brilliantly skilled Mr. <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriskcarey/'>Christopher Carey</a>, our dev team worked tirelessly to make this little dream a virtual reality; it is with immeasurable thanks to both of them that old Bill finally has a home of his own!
          <br/><br/>
          Over those six years, Bootleg Bill's has developed into an ongoing project centered on creating cassette releases for various media productions -- some, for example, are based on tapes physically depicted in a production; others are soundtracks and curated mixes from works where a cassette would be thematically appropriate, while a growing few are replications of rare or obscure original releases.
          <br/>
          The majority of cassettes "available" in our store have in fact been physically reproduced as one-of-a-kind art pieces. The rest are in various stages of design and planning for eventual production, save for our vinyl records which are a strictly conceptual exercise in graphic design and image manipulation. <span className='smol'>at least until we have our own record press</span>
          <br/><br/>
          This website ultimately now serves as my portfolio for the graphic design elements of these projects, and the presentation of Bootleg Bill's Unofficial Audio Rarities as a web store is in <span className='drama'>no way</span> representative of any availability for purchase.
          <br/><br/>
          However, if you would like to contact us regarding any of the designs featured here, send us an email at... uh, I'll get back to you on that.
          <br/><br/>
          Until then, be excellent to each other!
          <br/><br/>
